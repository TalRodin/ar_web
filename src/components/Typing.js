I first introduced to programming in school, taking Python programming language. I had an incredible Professor, who made me fall in love with coding. Since that, I learned additional programming languages such as JavaScript, C++, Matlab, SQL, etc. separately, or studied during classes Math/Physics. My knowledge and skills are very diverse from Front-end to Back-end. I work with different frameworks, libraries. In my free time, I enjoy snowboarding, swimming, horse riding, painting/drawing."
